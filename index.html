 <h1 id="about">About Us:</h1>
 <p id="about1">Nawalpur ITF Taekwondo is a dynamic and disciplined martial arts organization dedicated to promoting the values, principles, and techniques of International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) in the Nawalpur region. As a proud affiliate of the ITF, our mission is to empower individuals—especially youth—with the spirit of self-discipline, confidence, respect, and physical fitness through the structured practice of Taekwon-Do. We believe Taekwon-Do is more than just a sport; it is a way of life that teaches perseverance, integrity, and indomitable spirit. Our dojang (training center) is a hub of both tradition and modern instruction, where students learn not only the technical aspects such as patterns (tuls), sparring, self-defense, and breaking, but also absorb the deep-rooted philosophical foundation laid by General Choi Hong Hi, the founder of ITF. Nawalpur ITF Taekwondo organizes regular belt tests, seminars, competitions, and community events to build a strong sense of unity and continuous improvement. Whether training for fitness, competition, or personal growth, our students are guided by experienced and certified instructors who are committed to helping each individual reach their highest potential. Through discipline and dedication, Nawalpur ITF Taekwondo aims to nurture a generation that is mentally strong, morally upright, and physically capable—carrying forward the legacy of ITF Taekwon-Do with pride and purpose.</p>

<section class="History"> 
  <h1 id="title">Extended History of Nawalpur ITF Taekwondo</h1>
  <h1 id="title1">wellcome to</h1>
 <pre id="history"> <p id="p1">Six years ago today, on 26th Shrawan 
2075 BS, the District Taekwondo Association was formed in Nawalpur. 
In accordance with the democratic constitution of the Government
of Nepal and the prevailing laws and regulations of the current
Government of Nepal, and considering the current situation
where the country has entered a completely federal structure,
the 'Nepal ITF Taekwondo Federation' held a meeting on
26th Shrawan 2075 BS. As per the decision of that meeting
and the current structure, the former Nawalparasi district
was divided into Province No. 4 and 5, and the district
was further divided into Parasi district west of Bardaghat
Triveni and the new Nawalpur district. Thus, the 'Nepal
ITF Taekwondo Federation Nawalpur District Taekwondo 
Association ITF' working committee was born in the new 
Nawalpur district. This meeting, held on Saturday the
26th, saw the establishment of this organization in
Daunne, Nawalpur, under the chairmanship of Mr. Thum 
Bahadur Bahik Magar (Prakash), the central member
and coordinator of Province No. 4 of the Nepal ITF 
Taekwondo Federation, and in the presence of the respected
founder president of the Nepal ITF Taekwondo Federation, 
Mr. Rajkumar Thapa. In this meeting, Mr. Bir Kunwar 
was declared the founding president of this organization.</p>

<p id="p2">Mr. Bir Kunwar remained as president from 2075 BS to 2079 
BS. Bir Kunwar was born in Makar, Bardaghat 1. He grew up and studied
there. For the development of ITF Taekwondo, Mr. Bir Kunwar left
his birthplace, mother, father, home, and family and came to 
Nawalpur. Perhaps due to the new place and the lack of his own
people and relatives, he faced many difficulties in Nawalpur.
Many problems arose, and he was surrounded by difficult situations.
He visited many schools, colleges, and communities but could 
not establish ITF Taekwondo. There is a saying, "The smooth 
leaf of a growing plant." Bir never thought negatively and always
focused on the positive aspects, continuously applying his
skills, dedication to Taekwondo, and enthusiasm. Those days
were very difficult, but he always worked hard. There is a Hindi
saying, "Those who strive never lose." Bir also never gave up.
</p>

<p id="p3">Immediately after this, between Jestha and Ashad of 2076 BS
(2019 AD), Samata Shiksha Niketan Center also got the opportunity 
to open ITF Taekwondo. After that, the development of ITF Taekwondo
started to increase. The pessimistic problems in Veer Kunwar's mind 
began to disappear. Immense hope and waves of happiness started to arise 
in his mind, and the development of ITF Taekwondo was ongoing. About 
a year later, Bishal Pandey came to develop ITF Taekwondo and started
supporting Veer Kunwar. Veer Kunwar and Bishal Pandey visited many 
places to develop ITF Taekwondo. They opened dojangs and increased 
the number of players. Two years later, Raju Ale came to further 
enhance the development of ITF. Raju Ale started working as an
assistant. With great challenge and hard work, ITF started opening
in every part of Nawalpur. In areas of Nawalpur district where 
martial arts had not reached, these three individuals dedicated 
themselves completely to ITF Taekwondo, working tirelessly without
caring for hunger, thirst, sun, or rain, and established ITF Taekwondo
in all 8 municipalities of Nawalpur district, whether in the hills or
plains, which other martial arts could not even dare to do. This is 
how Veer Kunwar, Bishal Pandey, and Raju Ale together made ITF flourish.
Thus, the first initial tenure from 2076/04/26 BS (August 11, 2019 AD)
passed.</p>

<p id="p4">On 2079/04/03 BS (July 19, 2022 AD), the second district 
convention of Nawalpur District Taekwondo Association ITF was held.
In this convention, Veer Kunwar was again elected as the President 
for the presidential term. In this convention, the second district 
convention was held in the Community Forest building of Belani 
Madhurpokhari, Hupsekot Rural Municipality Ward No. 3, under the 
chairmanship of Veer Kunwar and with the chief guest being the 
Chairperson of Hupsekot Rural Municipality, Ms. Laxmi Devi Pandey,
and even today, Veer Kunwar is still holding the responsibility 
of the chairperson.</p>

<p id="p5">During these 6 years, many joys and sorrows were endured;
some supported, while others opposed. But even after 6 years, 
thousands of players have been produced within Nawalpur district,
and hundreds have achieved success in black belts, while many players 
have been declared provincial and national players.</p> </pre>
